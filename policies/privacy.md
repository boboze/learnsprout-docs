This document was last updated on: **March 16, 2015**

-----

Welcome, and thank you for your interest in LearnSprout, Inc. ("**LearnSprout**", "**us**", "**we**" or "**our**") and our Service, as described in the [LearnSprout Terms of Service](https://www.learnsprout.com/terms).

This LearnSprout Privacy Policy (the "**Privacy Policy**") describes the Information that you trust us with and how we handle the Information in terms of the steps we take to protect your Information. By using the Service, you consent to the privacy practices described in this Privacy Policy.

This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the LearnSprout Terms of Service (the "**Terms of Service**") that can be found at: https://www.learnsprout.com/terms. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this Privacy Policy have the meaning given to them in the Terms of Service.

For purposes of this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Service, "**you**" or "**your**" means:

1. the individual who is agreeing to the Terms of Service and this Privacy Policy, and registering for an Account with LearnSprout on behalf of your Subscribing Organization (as defined below);

2. any other individual authorized to use the Service on behalf of the Subscribing Organization and who uses the Service; and

3. the school, organization, company or other entity on whose behalf that you (as the individual) are registering for an Account and on whose behalf that you are using the Services (the "**Subscribing Organization**").

At LearnSprout, we take data security and the privacy of your students very seriously. Protecting personally identifiable information ("**PII**") of your students is at the very core of what we do. Once the connection to LearnSprout is made, your Information is secured on a remote, dedicated server. Your Information is kept separate from other Subscribing Organizations, so there is no possible way for other LearnSprout customers to view your students' PII. LearnSprout is FERPA compliant and adheres to all other federal and state laws in regard to student data. LearnSprout does not share, sell, or use school personally identifiable information for marketing purposes.

## The information that you send and share with us

* **User Information**.  User Information is described in Section 6 of the Terms of Service, that can be found at: https://www.learnsprout.com/terms

* **School Student Information**. School Student Information is described in Section 6 of the Terms of Service, that can be found at: https://www.learnsprout.com/terms. The School Student Information covers a variety of informational fields (the "**School Data Fields**") that will be synchronized with the Service. The School Student Information that you provide to the Service may include personally identifiable information of your students. Personally identifiable information is information provided such as student name, address and ethnicity.  If you would like to review our standard categories of the School Data Fields, please go to [here](https://www.learnsprout.com/policies). As part of the Service, you will also be able to manually enter additional information related to the School Student Information on an individual student basis (this additional information is also deemed "School Student Information" for purposes of the Terms). We reserve the right to update and change the School Data Fields, but will only do so upon prior notice to you. IF YOU DON'T AGREE TO ANY CHANGES TO THE SCHOOL STUDENT DATA FIELDS, THEN YOU MUST PROVIDE US WITH WRITTEN NOTICE TO SUPPORT@LEARNSPROUT.COM AND WE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT (INCLUDING ALL RELATED SCHOOL STUDENT INFORMATION) UNLESS YOU NOTIFY US OTHERWISE.

We may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the Service.

When you use the Service or open one of our HTML e-mails, we may automatically record certain information from your web browser by using different types of technology, including "clear gifs" or "web beacons." This "automatically collected" information may include your IP address or other device address or ID, web browser and/or device type, the pages you view on the Service, and the dates and times that you visit, access, or use the Service. This information is gathered for all users using the Service and assists us with enhancing the Service and the user experience of the Service.

## How we may use the information you send and share with us

We use the information that you send and share with us in a variety of ways for providing the Service to you and enhancing the Service. For example:

* We will use all of the non-PII information that you provide to us to improve the Service and to create new features and functionality.

* As a service that stores PII on your behalf, it is our policy to limit the exposure and storage of PII for only currently enrolled students in your school or school district. We implement this policy by deleting all PII of a student that is no longer enrolled in your school or school district within 60 days of you notifying us of a student's termination of enrollment. We may, however, maintain anonymized or aggregated information, including usage data, for analytics purposes.

* We may use your e-mail address (a) to contact you for administrative purposes such as customer service, to address intellectual property infringement, right of privacy violations or defamation issues related to your Information posted on the Service or (b) to send you promotional messages related to the Service and the activities of third parties we work with. Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving any such communications, either through links provided in the messages or by updating your account preferences through the Service.

* We may use "cookies" information to: (a) personalize our services, such as remembering your information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you visit the Service; (b) monitor and analyze the effectiveness of the Service; (d) monitor aggregate site usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed

## When and if we disclose information

We do not rent or sell your information! We may, however, disclose the Information that you provide to us (including PII) in the following circumstances:

* Any Information, including PII that you voluntarily choose to leave accessible in a public area (such as leaving your computer unprotected and the Service open) or available to other users (usually within your school or school district), will be available to anyone who you allow access to that Information.

* We work with third-party service providers to provide application development, website hosting (such as Amazon web services), maintenance, and other related services for us. To the extent it is necessary for these third-party service providers to fulfill their contractual obligations to us, these third parties may have access to or process the PII that you provide to us. Any such third parties have security policies that include requirements and protections as strict as our Security Policy. Our Security Policy can be found at: https://www.learnsprout.com/security. The third party recipients are limited to using the Information for the sole purpose for which it was provided and are subject to confidentiality agreements.

* We may be required to share Information with law enforcement or other third parties when compelled to do so by court order or other legal process, to comply with statutes or regulations or to enforce our Terms of Service.

* If LearnSprout, or substantially all of its assets are acquired, the assignee will assume and be subject to the same obligations of the Terms of Service, this Privacy Policy and our Security Policy that we are obligated. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of LearnSprout may continue to use the Information you provide to us as set forth in this Privacy Policy and [Terms of Service](https://www.learnsprout.com/terms). In the unlikely event that the likelihood of us going out of business or entering bankruptcy is imminent, we will provide you with thirty (30) daysâ€™ notice to use the Service and after such 30 days all data will be permanently deleted.

You may also choose to discontinue the use of the Service by sending a request to: support@learnsprout.com. Upon confirmation of your request, we will permanently delete all School Student Information associated with your account from the Service. We may continue to use your name and contact email as provided in your User Information for the purpose of sending you informational emails of our Services, unless you decide to opt out of receiving any such emails.
